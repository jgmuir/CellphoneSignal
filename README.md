# CellphoneSignal

CSCE 462 Project

Android App written in Java to detect RF signals

Week of 4/06/2020: Uploaded basic Android project to Github.

Week of 4/13/2020: Updated Android project to better reflect the Design Doc (added Navigation bar, three screens, basic screen).

Week of 4/20/2020: Set up home screen to near final look/information, added static graphs in wifi and cell screens. Need to work on having those graphs update over time with values. Added real-time graph example, need to connect it to actual signals to trace, and need to adjust scaling/look of graph.

Week of 4/27/2020: Connected Wifi and Cellular Signal reading to the app, tested and debugged features on my mom's Android Galaxy S10 phone. Got real-time signal updating and analysis running, and app is completed. Only quality of life features will be changed/minor bugs fixed if anything else is to be done with this project, as of 4/29/2020
